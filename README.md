## 📘 PROJECT OVERVIEW

THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES THE COMPLEXITY OF CHARGE TRANSPORT IN SEMICONDUCTORS BY INTRODUCING A **COMPREHENSIVE MACHINE LEARNING PIPELINE**. 

KEY CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDE:
- SYNTHETIC DATA GENERATION BASED ON STRICT EXPERIMENTAL RANGES (10,000 SAMPLES).
- PREDICTION OF AC CONDUCTIVITY USING ADVANCED REGRESSION MODELS (RANDOM FOREST, GRADIENT BOOSTING, XGBOOST, SVR).
- EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) TO VALIDATE PHYSICAL DEPENDENCIES.
- MODELING THE INFLUENCE OF FREQUENCY AND TEMPERATURE ON AC CONDUCTIVITY IN TLINTE2 SINGLE CRYSTALS.
- GLOBAL AND LOCAL INTERPRETABILITY USING PARTIAL DEPENDENCE PLOTS (PDP) AND SHAP ANALYSIS.

---

## 💬 FEATURES

- PHYSICS-BASED TARGET CALCULATION: σ_ac = ε₀ ε_r ω tan(δ)
- DISTRIBUTION-AWARE DATA SYNTHESIS (TEMPERATURE, FREQUENCY, CRYSTALLITE SIZE, DISLOCATION DENSITY, MICRO STRAIN).
- EXTENSIVE PRE-TRAINING EDA (HISTOGRAMS, KDE, CORRELATION HEATMAPS).
- RIGOROUS MIN-MAX NORMALIZATION FOR NUMERICAL STABILITY.
- COMPREHENSIVE ALGORITHM BENCHMARKING (LINEAR TO TREE-BASED ENSEMBLES).
- ADVANCED POST-TRAINING DIAGNOSTICS (RESIDUAL ANALYSIS, LEARNING CURVES).
- EXPLAINABLE AI (XAI) INTEGRATION FOR FEATURE IMPACT VERIFICATION.

---

## ⚙️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE & PIPELINE

THE ARCHITECTURE IS DIVIDED INTO FOUR DISTINCT STAGES:
- **DATA DOMAIN**: PHYSICAL PARAMETER DEFINITION AND SYNTHETIC GENERATION BASED ON REAL-WORLD BOUNDS
- **PRE-PROCESSING DOMAIN**: STATISTICAL VISUALIZATION AND MIN-MAX SCALING TO PREVENT GRADIENT EXPLOSION.
- **MODELING DOMAIN**: TRAINING OVER 10+ REGRESSORS TO CAPTURE LINEAR AND NON-LINEAR DEPENDENCIES.
- **INTERPRETABILITY DOMAIN**: EXTRACTING PHYSICAL INSIGHTS VIA SHAP AND PDP/ICE PLOTS TO VALIDATE THE CBH MODEL.

---

## 🌐 PHYSICS-ML INTEGRATION



THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO VALIDATE ESTABLISHED PHYSICAL THEORIES THROUGH DATA:
- AC CONDUCTIVITY IN TLINTE2 IS DOMINATED BY THE CORRELATED BARRIER HOPPING (CBH) MODEL.
- MACHINE LEARNING MODELS CONFIRM THIS BY IDENTIFYING TEMPERATURE AND FREQUENCY AS THE MOST CRITICAL PREDICTORS.
- STRUCTURAL DEFECTS (MICRO STRAIN, DISLOCATION DENSITY) ARE STATISTICALLY ISOLATED FROM THE PURE AC RESPONSE, PROVING ALGORITHMIC COMPREHENSION OF THE DOMAIN PHYSICS.

---

## ⚙️ HOW IT WORKS

1. **DATA GENERATION**
   - SYNTHETIC MATERIAL DATA GENERATED USING UNIFORM DISTRIBUTIONS WITHIN VERIFIED EXPERIMENTAL RANGES.

2. **EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS**
   - PEARSON CORRELATION AND SCATTER MATRICES REVEAL INITIAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DIELECTRIC CONSTANTS AND FREQUENCY WITH AC CONDUCTIVITY.

3. **NORMALIZATION**
   - MIN-MAX SCALERS ARE APPLIED TO BOTH INDEPENDENT FEATURES AND THE MICROSCOPIC TARGET TO ENSURE STABILITY ACROSS DISTANCE-BASED MODELS (KNN, SVR).

4. **MODEL TRAINING**
   - MULTIPLE REGRESSORS COMPETE. ENSEMBLE METHODS LIKE RANDOM FOREST AND GRADIENT BOOSTING ARE EVALUATED AGAINST BASELINE LINEAR MODELS.

5. **POST-TRAINING DIAGNOSTICS**
   - R², RMSE, MAE, AND RESIDUAL PLOTS CONFIRM MODEL ACCURACY.

6. **PHYSICS VALIDATION (XAI)**
   - SHAP VALUES AND ICE PLOTS EXPLAIN THE EXACT MARGINAL EFFECT OF EACH FEATURE, CORROBORATING EXPERIMENTAL INSIGHTS.

## 🔄 ANALYTICAL DECISION FLOW

THE PIPELINE EXECUTES AS FOLLOWS:

- RAW SYNTHETIC SAMPLES ARE GENERATED WITH MATERIAL PROPERTIES.
- EXTENSIVE VISUALIZATION ENSURES DISTRIBUTION INTEGRITY.
- DATA IS SCALED AND SPLIT (80% TRAINING / 20% TESTING).
- MODELS ARE FIT TO THE TRAINING SET TO CAPTURE THE σ_ac FUNCTION.
- MODELS ARE EVALUATED ON THE UNSEEN TEST SET.
- THE BEST PERFORMING MODEL IS DECONSTRUCTED USING SHAP AND PDP TO PROVE THE ALGORITHM LEARNED THE GOVERNING PHYSICS RATHER THAN NOISE.

---

## 🏁 USAGE

1. RUN THE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK SEQUENTIALLY TO:
   - GENERATE THE 10,000-SAMPLE SYNTHETIC DATASET.
   - PERFORM EDA VISUALIZATIONS.
   - NORMALIZE AND TRAIN ALL ML MODELS.
   - EXTRACT PERFORMANCE METRICS.

2. ANALYZE THE OUTPUTS:
   - CORRELATION HEATMAPS.
   - ACTUAL VS. PREDICTED PLOTS.
   - LEARNING CURVES TO DIAGNOSE BIAS/VARIANCE.
   - SHAP SUMMARY PLOTS FOR FEATURE IMPORTANCE.

---

## 📈 RESULTS AND CONCLUSION



- RANDOM FOREST AND GRADIENT BOOSTING ACHIEVED THE HIGHEST ACCURACY, WITH R² VALUES OF 0.9998 AND 0.9987, RESPECTIVELY.
- SVR PERFORMED POORLY ON UN-SCALED DATA, REQUIRING THE IMPLEMENTED MIN-MAX NORMALIZATION.
- FEATURE IMPORTANCE ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT TEMPERATURE AND FREQUENCY ARE THE MOST CRITICAL FACTORS INFLUENCING AC CONDUCTIVITY.
- THE ALGORITHMIC RESULTS DIRECTLY ALIGN WITH AND VALIDATE THE CORRELATED BARRIER HOPPING (CBH) MODEL.
- THE FRAMEWORK DEMONSTRATES STRONG INTERPRETABILITY, PROVING THE EFFICACY OF ML IN ACCELERATING MATERIALS SCIENCE DISCOVERY.

---

## 🚀 FUTURE WORK

- IMPLEMENTATION OF DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURES FOR HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DEFECT ANALYSIS.
- INTEGRATION OF REAL-WORLD EXPERIMENTAL DATASETS FOR DIRECT TRANSFER LEARNING.
- HYPERPARAMETER TUNING USING BAYESIAN OPTIMIZATION.
- EXPANSION OF THE PIPELINE TO PREDICT DC CONDUCTIVITY AND THERMAL PROPERTIES.
